## About 

This project aims to develop an advanced conversational agent that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to enhance response quality and factual accuracy. Unlike traditional chatbots relying solely on pre-trained
knowledge, our system will incorporate real-time web scraping capabilities to retrieve up-to-date information from
the internet. By dynamically fetching and integrating external information during conversation, the agent can
provide more accurate, comprehensive, and current responses.
