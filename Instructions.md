Project 1: Conversational Agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Aleš): Develop a conversational agent that enhances the quality and accuracy of its responses by dynamically retrieving and integrating relevant external documents from the web. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, this system will perform real-time information retrieval, ensuring up-to-date answers. Potential applications include customer support, academic research assistance, and general knowledge queries. The project will involve natural language processing (NLP), web scraping, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to optimize answer quality.

Proposed methodology:

1. Literature review: Survey current approaches to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its applications in conversational systems.

2. Propose a relevant application and relevant datasets for training and evaluation.

3. Implement a pipeline for real-time information retrieval from external sources (e.g., Wikipedia, news articles, or academic papers), develop a conversational agent that incorporates retrieved information into responses using pre-trained models, experiment with prompt engineering techniques to improve coherence and factual accuracy of generated responses.

4. Evaluate response quality automatically using BLEU, ROUGE, and also human evaluation metrics such as coherence, informativeness, and factual consistency.

5. Prepare a final report with insights on how retrieval-augmented conversational agents can enhance answer quality in real-world applications.
